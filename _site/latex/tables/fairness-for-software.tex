    \hline
    \textbf{Princ.} & \textbf{Descrição} \\ \hline
    F: & Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.\\
    F1 & Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.\\
    F1.1 & Software components representing granularity levels are assigned distinct identifiers.\\
    F1.2 & Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers.\\
    F2 & Software is described with rich metadata. \\
    F3 & Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.\\
    F4 & Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable.\\ \hline
    A: & Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols.\\
    A1 & Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol. \\
    A1.1 & The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.\\
    A1.2 & The protocol allows for authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary. \\
    A2 & Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available.\\ \hline
    %\textbf{Princ.} & \textbf{Descrição} \\ \hline
    I: & Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.\\
    I1 &  Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards.\\
    I2 & Software includes qualified references to other objects.\\
      \hline
    R: & Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).\\
    R1 & Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.\\
    R1.1 & Software is given a clear and accessible license. \\ 
    R1.2 & Software is associated with detailed provenance.\\
    R2 & Software includes qualified references to other software.\\
    R3 & Software meets domain-relevant community standards. \\
